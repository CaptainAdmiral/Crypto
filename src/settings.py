NETWORK_DELAY = 0.2 
''' The average delay in seconds it takes for a net connection to successfuly propogate a packet to the target node '''
NETWORK_DELAY_VARIABILITY = 0.1
''' The ratio of standard deviation of the network delay to the mean delay

e.g a value of 0.1 will result in a standard deviation that's 1/10th of the mean delay '''
